# TS + React + Redux + Fetch

This project is a basic React application written entirely in TypeScript. It has been generated with the [template provided by Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

The application performs requests to a [public API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) using the standard Fetch API and uses `@redux/toolkit` to handle the received data and deal with pagination and search capabilities.

It also uses SCSS modules to better isolate the style definitions between components.

## Online playground

## Development

```

```

The application will be available in [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
